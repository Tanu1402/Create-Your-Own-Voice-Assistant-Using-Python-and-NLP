# Create-Your-Own-Voice-Assistant-Using-Python-and-NLP
Description of Main Functionalities:
Voice Command Recognition:

The assistant listens to user commands using the sounddevice library for audio capture and the speech_recognition library for speech-to-text conversion.
It identifies commands starting with the keyword "Alexa" and processes them accordingly.
Text-to-Speech Conversion:

Uses pyttsx3 to convert text responses into speech, enabling the assistant to communicate effectively.
Media Playback:

Recognizes commands containing "play" and uses pywhatkit to search and play songs on YouTube.
Time Inquiry:

Responds to queries about the current time, providing the time in a 12-hour AM/PM format.
Wikipedia Search:

Handles commands like "Who is...", fetching a short summary from Wikipedia using the wikipedia library.
Includes error handling for ambiguous results, missing pages, or other issues.
Joke Generator:

Shares jokes in response to commands containing "joke" using the pyjokes library.
Exit Command:

Stops the program when the user says "stop".
Error Handling:

Manages cases where the user's speech isn't clear or when external services (like Googleâ€™s speech recognition or Wikipedia) encounter issues, ensuring robust performance.
This assistant uses modern Python libraries to provide a fun and interactive experience, demonstrating practical applications of Natural Language Processing and voice automation.
